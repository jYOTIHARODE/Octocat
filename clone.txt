Q1 what git clone does?
Ans->
suppose I wanna work on a project with my friend So we are creating commits 
on itself.
And if my friend has created project .Then I need to copy the project on  
remote back to on the local computer and starting coding from that point onwards.
In git we can do the same process by doing a git clone.

A clone basically does three things...........
1) Git init-> it means we initialize a repository empty repository on the computer.
2) Add the URL to other github repository.
3) Performs the git pull.

To clone a project:-

*Firstly,go to the project you want to clone.
*Suppose a project we want to clone is git1.
*To clone git1,go to green button we see URL then we copy this URL and open fork.
*When we open fork we can cllone a repo to going into file then select clone.
Then there  we copied URL then type name then click "CLONE".
then we done cloning the project.
