Q3 What the 'Upstream' remote is usually used for?
Ans->
Any changes done in the remote branch is automatically seen to the fork .
So we get the latest change done by the developer .
So we will see our fork will be origin and 
our remote repository will be upstream.
So what is the difference between origin and upstream here.So origin basically
remote repository from where we have clone our repository.
