Q3 Explain what a branch is?
Ans->In the terms of project, branches are nothing more than a folder which contains
specific setup project.
Just consider we have a branch and we are doing multiple commits to it.
but if commits done by a single person it works well but if same feature commited 
by different persons , this would create issue and hard to manage 
Because someone would be working on the feature the other developer might push
something in branch now you have to be updated.
